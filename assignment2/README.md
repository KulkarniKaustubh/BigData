# Page Rank Algorithm implementation with Map Reduce

### Execution
#### Note: <b>Run run1.sh once</b>, and <b>run run2.sh iteratively </b>. This is only a test script to run a bunch of commands at a time. If you get the error, file cannot be executed, just chmod the permission.
```sh
$ sh run1.sh  
$ sh run2.sh  
```


### Whats left !?
- [x] Basic outline of task1 and task2
- [x] Hadoop streaming of task1 and task2
- [ ] take care of key error
- [ ] run the hadoop script, successfully (currently runs for 1 iteration)
